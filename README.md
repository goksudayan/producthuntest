Considering everything happening around ProductHunt for so long, to celebrate my almost one-year streak on ProductHunt, I made ChatGPT built a Chrome extension for mere fun. I only added one or two lines of code, the rest is all ChatGPT.

- I still think the voting feature is terrible for the indie hacking community.
- I still think featuring some products and not others on the homepage (deservedly or not, this one I don't care) is unfair to all.

How it works:

1. The homepage redirects to the all products of the day page.
2. All vote buttons hidden.
3. All products are randomly scrambled to ensure fairness.

This is just for fun and show people how PH would look like without a voting mechanism, nothing against ProductHunt. Kinda having fun, will remove the repo soon.
