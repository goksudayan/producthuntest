Considering everything happening around ProductHunt for so long, to celebrate my almost 355-day-streak on ProductHunt, I made ChatGPT built a Chrome extension for mere fun. I only added one or two lines of code, the rest is all ChatGPT.

I think:
- The voting feature is terrible for the indie hacking community.
- Featuring some products and not others on the homepage (deservedly or not, this one I don't care) is unfair to all.

How it works:

1. The homepage redirects to the products of the day page.
2. All vote buttons hidden.
3. All products are scrambled randomly to ensure fairness.

This is just for fun and to show people how PH would look like without a voting mechanism, nothing against ProductHunt. Kinda having fun, will remove the repo soon.
